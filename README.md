Answer for the assesment for the role Software developer at INI8.


I've used MySQL Workbench while writing the scripts. These are the steps to follow to run my script on MySQL Workbench

Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysql-registration.git
Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.

Create a new database (if not already created):

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS registration_db;
USE registration_db;
Open the create_registration_table.sql file from the cloned repository in MySQL Workbench.

Execute the script by clicking on the lightning icon or pressing Ctrl + Enter.
